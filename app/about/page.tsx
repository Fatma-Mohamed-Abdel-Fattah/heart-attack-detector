                  works to dramatically change the health outcomes of the most
                  vulnerable, particularly children, by improving comprehensive,
                  advanced cardiac care available to all people in need, free of

            A heart patient needs periodic follow-ups and going to the hospital
            to perform the necessary medical examinations to check on his heart.
            However, with the spread of infectious diseases that may affect the
            ability of a heart patient to go to hospitals, as happened in Corona
            disease, technological development must be exploited in following up
            with a heart patient remotely. Therefore, this project aims to
            reduce the time and effort required for the patient to follow up on
            the periodic health of the heart and health in general, with the
            presence of communication between the medical staff of the hospital
            and the patient in the event of a heart disorder or any health
            problems to conduct the necessary first aid. Moreover, this project
            enables healthy people to detect heart disease early and communicate
            with the medical staff remotely to provide them with appropriate
            treatment for their condition Our system is a complete electronic
            health system to connect heart patients to their hospitals for
            periodic follow-up of heart health. This system consists of a
            patient mobile app, an AI heart attack detector, and a website for
            the hospital. The widespread use of smartwatches as well as
            smartphones among most people, and thus the demand for our system
            will be increasing for ease of obtaining it .
